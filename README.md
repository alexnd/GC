*Goodness Corp*? or *Garbage Collector*? Who knows... Maybe its *Global Collection*, no its *Gone Cuties*!
LOL! ROFL! and LMAO...

I started this collection named "GC" in relationship but not only for JS.

You would feel as on a dump waste as well as happiest of happy-nanny nyan cat!

So, why **Javascript**?

I really not have an answer immediately...

Because, for example I can just run, in one line:

```
"foo".length
```

Or another one

```
"foo".match(/FOo/i)
```

Or even

```
++"foo1".match(/FOo(\d+)/i)[1]
```

Or *IIFE*, *JIT*, *event bubbling*, whatever... you know?

Nevermind, if you do ;) Its kick your ASs! Just remeber - GC!
