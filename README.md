*Goodness Corp*? or *Garbage Collector*? Who knows... Maybe its *Global Collection*, no its *Gone Cuties*!
LOL! ROFL! and LMAO...

I started this collection named "GC" in relationship but not only for JS.

You would feel as on a dump waste as well as happiest of happy-nanny nyan cat!

So, why **Javascript**?

I really not have an answer immediately...

Because, for example I can just run, in one line:

```
"foo".length
```

Or another one

```
"foo".match(/FOo/i)
```

Or even

```
++"foo1".match(/FOo(\d+)/i)[1]
```

Or *IIFE*, *JIT*, *event bubbling*, whatever... you know?

Nevermind, if you do ;) Its kick your ASs! Just remeber - GC!

Ok, well, shuffling some enother stuff...

##[ vim ]

Cut and paste:

Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.

Press **v** to select characters (or uppercase **V** to select whole lines).

Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.

Press **d** to cut (or **y** to copy).

Move to where you would like to paste.

Press **P** to paste before the cursor, or **p** to paste after.

Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press **y** instead of **d**:

**d** = delete = cut

**y** = yank = copy

Deleted or copied text is placed in the unnamed register. If wanted, a register can be specified so the text is also copied to the named register. A register is a location in Vim's memory identified with a single letter. A double quote character is used to specify that the next letter typed is the name of a register.

For example, you could select the text ```hello``` then type ```"ay``` to copy "hello" to the ```a``` register. Then you could select the text ```world``` and type ```"by``` to copy "world" to the ```b``` register. After moving the cursor to another location, the text could be pasted: type ```"ap``` to paste "hello" or ```"bp``` to paste "world". These commands paste the text after the cursor. Alternatively, type ```"aP``` or ```"bP``` to paste before the cursor.

You remember? **"**, than **register**, than operation (**yY dD pP**)

And yes... Please donâ€™t cut the purple trees!

Wooot!?
